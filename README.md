### Testing

[RSpec: Feature Testing](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/v/3-4/docs/feature-specs/feature-spec)

This app is a black magic box and we will treat it as such.
So only feature testing. Because why bother with anything else if the 
views aren't broken and the users can use the app successfully.

#### Ruby Style Guide

[Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)

I will try my best to adhere to Ruby Style Guide
since RubyMine still doesn't have support for Rubocop 
it can be a hit or miss.
